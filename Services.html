                        traditional houses, is the American Sports Bar. As the name suggests, it’s an American-style
                        bar mostly frequented by the international community living in Pristina. The American Sports
                        Bar is a great choice for travellers who may be feeling homesick or local people who just
                        want to drink some international or local beers and spend a night watching football or
                        rugby.</p>

                    festival to Tirana, Albania, and holding a special edition there, in exile, without budget. The echo
